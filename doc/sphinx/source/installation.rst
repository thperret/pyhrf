 Installation
==============

Instructions are given for linux and python2.7. The package is mainly developed and tested under Ubuntu 14.04, we then recommend this distribution.
We officially support Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04 and Fedora 20.

For **windows users**, a linux distribution can be installed easely inside a virtual machine such as Virtual Box. This wiki page explains `how to install ubuntu from scratch in Virtual Box <http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox>`_ or you can get some `free VirtualBox images <http://virtualboxes.org/images/ubuntu/>`_.

Linux-based
***********

============

The following has been tested on a new installed Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS version.

Install the following packages::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pip python-sympy gcc

The version of nibabel and nipy packages available in the Ubuntu 12.04 repositories are too old, install newer version with::

    $ pip install --user nibabel
    $ pip install --user nipy

Optional dependencies::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-scikits-learn python-joblib python-sphinx python-pygraph python-pygraphviz python-PIL python-munkres

Ubuntu 14.04
============

The following has been tested on a new installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS version.

Required packages::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-nibabel python-nipy

Optional dependencies::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-scikits-learn python-joblib python-sphinx python-pygraph python-pygraphviz python-PIL python-munkres

=================

The following has been tested on a new installed Debian 7.7.

Required packages::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pip python-sympy python-nibabel gcc

Not available on system repositories::

Main dependencies::

    $ sudo yum install python-devel numpy scipy python-matplotlib python-pip sympy git

These dependencies are not available as system packages, they have to be installed
by hand ::

    $ pip install --user nibabel
    $ pip install --user nipy

Optional dependencies::

    $ sudo yum install PyQt4 python-matplotlib-qt4 graphviz-python python-sphinx python-scikit-learn python-pillow python-joblib

.. _Pyhrf download:

PyHRF download
##############

Release tarball
***************

The latest pyhrf release (v0.3) is available `here <http://www.pyhrf.org/dist/pyhrf-0.3.tar.gz>`_.
Extract it and follow the pyHRF installation guide above.


Source repository
*****************

First, if git is not installed (``git --version`` does not work), install it from your system packages::

    $ sudo apt-get install git # on Ubuntu and Debian
    $ sudo yum install git # on Fedora as root

The bleeding edge version of pyhrf is available via github. In a folder where you want to create the pyhrf repository, use the command::

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyhrf/pyhrf.git pyhrf

Then, to get the latest changes afterwards::

    $ cd pyhrf
    $ git pull

.. _Pyhrf installation:

PyHRF Installation
##################

In the directory where the pyhrf tarball has been decompressed or in the pyhrf git repository, you can install it globally or locally:

- global installation::

    $ python setup.py install

 This will attempt to write in the Python site-packages directory and will fail if you don't have the appropriate permissions (you usually need root privilege).

- local installation::

    $ python setup.py install --user

- local installation in develop mode (only links to the source files are installed)::

    $ python setup.py develop --user

On Ubuntu and Debian, you need to add the commands folder to your ``PATH`` environement variable by adding the following to your ``$HOME/.profile``::

    if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin"  ]; then
        PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    fi

*** Run tests to check installation**::

    $ pyhrf_maketests

Configuration
#############

Package options are stored in ``$HOME/.pyhrf/config.cfg``, which is created after the installation. It handles global package options and the setup of parallel processing. Here is the default content of this file (section order may change)::

.. see :ref:`Parallel Computation <manual_parallel>`

Documentation
#############

Sphinx is used to build the document. You get it `here <http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html>`_.

To build the pyhrf documentation, launch the following command in the folder ``doc/sphinx`` located in the pyhrf repository::

   $ make html

This will create a folder ``html`` with all the documentation (start page: ``html/index.html``.
